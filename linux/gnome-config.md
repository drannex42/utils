# Gnome Config

Yes, I know I am incredibly lame by using Ubuntu and Gnome (Ubuntu flavor) as my default DE and OS - but after trying them all, distro jumping every few months (or days...), and dealing with all the security issues and misplaced configs - Ubuntu really just works for what I need, and the same goes for gnome (with a tonne of extensions and mods added, of course). 

## Proper Dock 

### Cycle Windows on Dock Click
```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock click-action 'cycle-windows'
```
